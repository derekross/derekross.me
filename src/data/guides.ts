    description: 'Practical guide for getting started with nostr clients and understanding the basics.',
    type: 'Guide',
    category: 'general',
    content: `
Nostr is much, much more than a Twitter alternative. Nostr allows us to have portable digital social identities that we can use in various applications and capacities. For this next iteration of #HOWDONOSTR I'll focus on a few of the applications that I use and the various ways that I use Nostr.

Since we know that Nostr uses a public and private key pair and keeping our private key safe is of utmost importance, we'll start this off with the basics and then move on to relays, before discussing applications.

## Key Management

- **On my desktop**, to login to and utilize the various applications, I'll use the Alby web browser extension to manage my private key. This works with Chrome, Brave, Firefox, etc. You can install it here: [https://getalby.com](https://getalby.com)
- **On my Android phone**, I'll use the Amber application to keep my private key safe when using native applications that support it. You can download Amber here: [https://github.com/greenart7c3/Amber](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Amber)
- I'll also use the **Kiwi web browser** for accessing many web applications. With the Kiwi browser, I'll use the Nostr Connect extension because it's more lightweight than Alby. You can download Kiwi Browser for Android here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser) You can install the extension here: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nostr-connect/ampjiinddmggbhpebhaegmjkbbeofoaj](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nostr-connect/ampjiinddmggbhpebhaegmjkbbeofoaj)

## Running Your Own Relays

Nostr allows us to be in-charge of our digital social identity and allows us to be in-charge of our entire social graph. We can accomplish this by running our own relay. I do this in two parts.

- I run a **private local relay** on my Android phone. This allows me to easily write offline notes and save all of my drafts to my phone where they are not accessible by anyone but myself. I do this with the Citrine application. You can download it here: [https://github.com/greenart7c3/Citrine](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Citrine)
- I also run a **publicly accessible relay** that only my wife and myself have write access. That means that no one else can save their social information to my relay, but everyone in the world can access my relay to read our notes and events. I use the Nostream relay for this. You can get started with Nostream here: [https://github.com/cameri/nostream](https://github.com/cameri/nostream)

Do I need to run two relays? Maybe not, but I do, because I can. Nostr allows me to easily do these more technical things if I want to do them, allowing me to be fully in control of my entire social graph and social identity.

Now that I have my private key being secured and managed and my notes and events are stored on my personal relays, I'm ready to start using various Nostr applications!

## Mobile Applications

My number one daily driver is **Amethyst for Android**. It allows me to login via Amber to keep my private key safe. It allows me to easily use my private relay that runs on my smartphone. I use Amethyst because of the number of features that it supports, integrating with many other Nostr clients and various aspects of the protocol. From AI generated feeds of notes, to a bitcoin powered marketplace, to live streams and more. However, Amethyst does suffer from some stability issues and causes me headaches from time to time. Because of this, I also use **Primal**. Primal is smooth and stable. It lacks some of the extras that Amethyst has, but if I want an experience that just works, I choose Primal.

## Web Applications

Nostr really shines on the web. Most of Nostr's Other Stuff clients are not native applications for Android and iOS, they're web applications - regular websites powered by Nostr. Remember, to securely use these applications, you'll need one of the web browsers and extensions that I mentioned above. Alternatively, you can also use many of these with nsec.app. This website runs a Nostr nsecBunker in your web browser, allowing this application to function as a secure key management application.

### Social Clients
- **Snort.social** or **Iris.to** are popular clients, but not performing for me as well as they used to, so now I'm using **Primal.net** and **Coracle.social** more and more. Primal is very stable and simple, but Coracle is loaded with features that keep bringing me back. Coracle's new custom feeds feature is a game changer, however the UI is a bit much and may seem overly complicated.

### Audio & Video
- For **audio chats**, I listen to **NostrNests.com** where people chat with friends and Plebchain Radio hosts their weekly podcast. I used to do weekly shows here every Monday, but it's been a while for me.
- **Zap.stream** is a Twitch or YouTube alternative for video consumption. Here, I watch friends and streamers here, interacting with them live, chatting, zapping, and consuming all that they have to offer. Sometimes it's weekly podcast shows, sometimes it's gamers playing video games, or sometimes it's just developers hacking away at code during a live coding session.
- **Tunestr.io** is a website similar to Zap.stream, but it's specifically for live musical performances.

### Content & Publishing
- I use **Highlighter.com** for reading long form notes or blog posts, but I also use Highlighter for sometimes writing my own. Content creators can also use Highlighter to create subscription tiers, similar to Patreon. I don't use that feature, but it's nice to have for those looking to fund their content in other ways similar to what exists elsewhere on the web.

### Utilities & Tools
- I use **listr.lol** to manage my Nostr lists, to help me organize npubs that I follow.
- I use **metadata.nostr.com** to restore my Nostr profile, including my contact list, if a rogue client accidentally deletes or alters my contact list in a way that I didn't intend. This does happen from time to time. We're early.
- I use **w3.do** to create Nostr powered shortlinks for sharing with others.

### Music & Commerce
- I use **Wavlake** to listen to music, supporting artists in a value for value manner. I use this application on the web and I use this application on my Android phone too.
- I use **Shopstr.store** to sell items, such as old Android phones. I've sold 3 via this Nostr powered marketplace.
- I use **Zap.store** to manage applications on my Android phone as an alternative to Google Play or Obtainium.

I use these applications the most, but many more applications exist across the Nostr ecosystem. I encourage you to check out [https://www.nostrapps.com](https://www.nostrapps.com) from time to time and see what's available.

    title: 'What are Relays?',
    description: 'Understanding the backbone of nostr - relay servers and how they work.',
    type: 'Guide',
    category: 'relays',
    content: `
Relays are the backbone of the Nostr network. They are simple servers that store and forward Nostr events. Think of them as the post offices of the Nostr ecosystem - they receive messages (events) from users and deliver them to other users who are interested in receiving them.

## How Relays Work

When you publish a note on Nostr, your client sends that note to one or more relays. These relays then store your note and make it available to anyone who queries for it. When someone wants to see your notes, their client asks relays for events from your public key.

The beauty of this system is that it's decentralized. There's no single company or entity that controls all the relays. Anyone can run a relay, and users can choose which relays to use.

## Types of Relays

### Public Relays
These are open relays that anyone can read from and write to. Examples include:
- relay.damus.io
- relay.snort.social
- nostr.wine
- relay.nostr.band

### Private Relays
These relays restrict who can write to them, but may allow anyone to read. This is useful for:
- Personal backup of your own notes
- Family or group communication
- Reducing spam and noise

### Paid Relays
Some relays charge a small fee (usually in Bitcoin via Lightning) to write events. This helps:
- Reduce spam
- Cover server costs
- Ensure quality content

## Choosing Relays

Most Nostr clients come with a default set of relays, but you can customize your relay list. Consider:

- **Geographic location**: Closer relays may be faster
- **Reliability**: Some relays have better uptime than others
- **Policies**: Different relays have different content policies
- **Speed**: Some relays are faster at storing and retrieving events

## Running Your Own Relay

Running your own relay gives you complete control over your data. Popular relay software includes:
- Nostream (Node.js)
- Strfry (C++)
- Relay (Go)

Benefits of running your own relay:
- Complete control over your data
- No censorship concerns
- Can serve as backup for your content
- Can be shared with family/friends

## Relay Discovery

Nostr uses several methods for relay discovery:
- NIP-65 (Relay List Metadata) - users publish their preferred relays
- NIP-05 (DNS-based verification) - domain names can specify relays
- Word of mouth and recommendations
- Relay directories and lists

Remember: relays are just dumb servers. They don't understand the content they're storing - they just store and forward events based on simple filters. This simplicity is what makes Nostr so robust and censorship-resistant.

    id: 'what-is-a-nostr-address',
    title: 'What is a Nostr Address?',
    description: 'Understanding nostr addresses and how they work for identity verification.',
    type: 'Guide',
    category: 'general',
    content: `
A Nostr address (also called NIP-05 identifier) is a human-readable identifier that looks like an email address, such as derek@derekross.me. It provides a way to verify your identity and make it easier for people to find you on Nostr.

## How Nostr Addresses Work

Unlike email addresses, Nostr addresses don't actually receive messages. Instead, they serve as a verification mechanism that proves you control a particular domain name and links it to your Nostr public key.

When someone enters your Nostr address, clients perform a lookup to:
1. Verify that you control the domain
2. Find your public key
3. Optionally discover your preferred relays

## Benefits of Nostr Addresses

### Human-Readable Identity
Instead of sharing a long public key like \`npub1...\`, you can share \`derek@derekross.me\` which is much easier to remember and share.

### Verification
A Nostr address provides social proof that you control a particular domain. This helps prevent impersonation and builds trust.

### Discoverability
People can find you more easily by searching for your domain name or username.

### Relay Hints
Your Nostr address can include information about which relays to find your content on.

## Setting Up a Nostr Address

### Option 1: Use a Service
Many services offer free Nostr addresses:
- nostrplebs.com
- iris.to
- snort.social
- current.fyi

Simply sign up and follow their instructions to link your public key.

### Option 2: Use Your Own Domain
If you own a domain, you can create your own Nostr address:

1. Create a \`.well-known/nostr.json\` file on your domain
2. Add your public key and optional relay information
3. Configure your Nostr client to use this address

Example \`.well-known/nostr.json\` file:
\`\`\`json
{
  "names": {
    "derek": "npub18ams6ewn5aj2n3wt2qawzglx9mr4nzksxhvrdc4gzrecw7n5tvjqctp424"
  },
  "relays": {
    "npub18ams6ewn5aj2n3wt2qawzglx9mr4nzksxhvrdc4gzrecw7n5tvjqctp424": [
      "wss://relay.damus.io",
      "wss://relay.snort.social"
    ]
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Important Considerations

### Not Required
Nostr addresses are completely optional. You can use Nostr perfectly fine without one.

### Domain Dependency
If you lose control of your domain, you lose your Nostr address. However, your Nostr identity (public/private key pair) remains intact.

### Privacy
Using a Nostr address may reduce your privacy since it links your Nostr identity to a domain name.

### Verification Only
Remember that a Nostr address only verifies domain control, not identity. Anyone can create derek@example.com if they control example.com.

## Best Practices

- Choose a domain you trust and will control long-term
- Keep your private key secure - the Nostr address doesn't protect it
- Consider using a subdomain (nostr.yoursite.com) to separate your Nostr identity
- Regularly verify that your address is working correctly

Nostr addresses make Nostr more user-friendly while maintaining the protocol's decentralized nature. They're a great way to make your Nostr identity more professional and discoverable.

    title: 'What is Zapvertising?',
    description: 'Discover how zaps can be used for advertising and content promotion in a decentralized way.',
    type: 'Guide',
    category: 'zaps',
    content: `
Zapvertising is a revolutionary approach to advertising that leverages Bitcoin's Lightning Network and the Nostr protocol to create a more direct, value-driven advertising ecosystem. Instead of traditional ad networks that extract value from both advertisers and users, zapvertising creates direct connections between content creators and their audience.

## What Makes Zapvertising Different

Traditional advertising is broken. Users are bombarded with irrelevant ads, their data is harvested without compensation, and creators receive only a fraction of advertising revenue. Zapvertising flips this model on its head.

With zapvertising:
- **Users get paid** to view and interact with content
- **Creators receive direct support** without intermediaries
- **Advertisers reach engaged audiences** who are genuinely interested
- **No data harvesting** or privacy violations

## How Zapvertising Works

### For Content Creators
1. Create valuable content on Nostr
2. Set up Lightning address for receiving zaps
3. Engage with your audience authentically
4. Receive direct support through zaps

### For Advertisers/Sponsors
1. Find creators whose audience aligns with your product
2. Sponsor content directly by zapping creators
3. Request mentions or reviews in exchange for zaps
4. Build genuine relationships with influencers

### For Users/Audience
1. Follow creators you enjoy
2. Receive value through quality content
3. Support creators you appreciate with zaps
4. Potentially earn zaps for engagement and sharing

## Types of Zapvertising

### Direct Creator Support
The simplest form - directly zapping creators whose content you value or want to promote.

### Sponsored Content
Creators can be sponsored to mention products or services, with payment happening instantly via Lightning.

### Bounty Programs
Companies can offer zap bounties for specific types of content, reviews, or user-generated content.

    title: 'What is the Outbox Model?',
    description: 'Learn about the outbox model for improved relay management and content discovery.',
    type: 'Guide',
    category: 'relays',
    content: `
Nostr is a decentralized network with complex interactions among users, bots, topics, and relays, and finding specific content within this system is challenging. The process involves two main components: defining what users are looking for and finding the right relay to serve the content. However, relay selection is difficult because relying on a small set of popular relays can result in missing content or censorship, and random relay selection leads to centralization.

The Outbox Model, introduced by NIP 65, addresses this issue by allowing users to select "read" and "write" relays based on content types. This model improves content retrieval by directing queries to specific relays, reducing data transfer and connections, but it still requires the correct relay list setup, which isn't always guaranteed.

The model's effectiveness depends on reliable relay selections, which are impacted by factors like geographic proximity, content retention policies, and censorship. While Outbox is not a complete solution for all types of content or use cases, it offers a framework for more efficient relay selection and content indexing. Future developments might involve specialized clients or relay proxies to improve the user experience.

## How the Outbox Model Works

The Nostr Outbox Model (NIP-65) allows users to define which relays they want to use for sending notes directly within their profile, improving efficiency and relay management. By declaring this in a special event kind via their profile relay settings, users set preferences on where their events should be sent. This reduces user confusion and fuels decentralization.

The simplest take away here is that users no longer need to have a shared common relay between them to communicate. Clients handle all of the heavy lifting for them. This change simplifies both the client experience and relay coordination, aligning with decentralized social networking principles.

With the Outbox Model, users can use a variety of small and community relays, and still communicate with one another.

## Benefits of the Outbox Model

### Improved Decentralization
Users can spread their content across multiple smaller relays instead of concentrating on a few large ones.

### Better Content Discovery
Clients know exactly where to look for a user's content based on their declared relay preferences.

### Reduced Relay Load
By distributing content across multiple relays, no single relay becomes overwhelmed.

### Enhanced Censorship Resistance
If one relay censors content, users can still find it on other relays in the user's outbox list.

## Practical Implementation

What does this look like and how does this work in practice? Check out this interactive demonstration: [https://how-nostr-works.pages.dev/#/outbox](https://how-nostr-works.pages.dev/#/outbox)

For a deeper dive into the technical details, here's a comprehensive article on the Outbox model by Hodlbod: [https://habla.news/u/hodlbod@coracle.social/8YjqXm4SKY-TauwjOfLXS](https://habla.news/u/hodlbod@coracle.social/8YjqXm4SKY-TauwjOfLXS)

The Outbox Model represents a significant step forward in making Nostr more efficient and truly decentralized, while maintaining the protocol's core principles of censorship resistance and user sovereignty.

    type: 'Slidedeck',
    category: 'general',
    content: `
This is a comprehensive introduction to Nostr, covering the fundamental concepts that make this protocol revolutionary for decentralized social communication.

## What is Nostr?

Nostr stands for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays." It's a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media.

Unlike traditional social media platforms, Nostr doesn't rely on a central server or company. Instead, it uses a network of relays (servers) that anyone can run, and users control their own identity through cryptographic keys.

## Key Concepts

### Public Key Cryptography
- Every user has a **public key** (like your username) and a **private key** (like your password)
- Your public key is your identity on Nostr - it never changes
- Your private key is used to sign messages, proving they came from you
- **Never share your private key** - it's like giving someone complete control of your account

### Relays
- Relays are servers that store and forward messages
- Anyone can run a relay
- Users can connect to multiple relays
- If one relay goes down or censors you, you can use others

### Clients
- Clients are apps that connect to relays and display content
- Many different clients exist for web, mobile, and desktop
- You can switch between clients while keeping the same identity
- Examples: Damus, Amethyst, Primal, Iris, Snort

## How Nostr Works

1. **Create an Identity**: Generate a public/private key pair
2. **Choose Relays**: Connect to one or more relay servers
3. **Publish Content**: Sign messages with your private key and send to relays
4. **Discover Content**: Query relays for messages from people you follow
5. **Interact**: Like, reply, and share content across the network

## Why Nostr Matters

### Censorship Resistance
- No single point of failure
- If one relay censors you, use another
- Your identity isn't tied to any platform

### User Ownership
- You own your identity and data
- Take your followers with you between apps
- No platform can delete your account

### Innovation
- Open protocol enables rapid innovation
- Developers can build new features without permission
- Interoperability between different apps

### Global Reach
- Works anywhere in the world
- No geographic restrictions
- Permissionless participation

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a Client**: Start with user-friendly options like Primal or Damus
2. **Secure Your Keys**: Use a browser extension like Alby or mobile app like Amber
3. **Find People**: Follow interesting accounts and discover communities
4. **Start Posting**: Share your thoughts and engage with others

## The Future of Social Media

Nostr represents a fundamental shift from platform-based to protocol-based social media. Instead of being trapped in walled gardens controlled by corporations, users can freely move between applications while maintaining their identity and social connections.

This is just the beginning. As more developers build on Nostr and more users join the network, we'll see innovations that aren't possible with traditional social media platforms.

Welcome to the future of decentralized social communication!
